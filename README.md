# LogiCraft
Software for 2D game creation using SFML and ImGUI.

## How it works
It's pretty simple:
  - Allows you to create a scene up to a size of 16 4k-screens.
  - For each allocated screen, it exports a screenshot in .png per layer.
  - It allows you to save the scene as well.
  - It also generates a second backup file so that you can recreate the objects in another program.
